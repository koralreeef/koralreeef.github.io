the wackiest game ever holy shit

# reiA <a name="reiA"></a>
the most normal shot in a sea of quirky and borderline unusable shorts

better routes would probably have me using the gap travel more

# mariB <a name="mariB"></a>
the routiest shottype ever; this shot is so fucking fun. i wish zun brought back shifting shot types whenever you focus/unfocus but alas
