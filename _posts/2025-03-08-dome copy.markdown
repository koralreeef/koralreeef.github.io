i am listening to The Garden - Red Green Yellow[^1] as i type this out

last week, a certain toontown fangame named "Toontown: The Grindworks"[^2] came out. and i played the shit out of it; a drop of water in a toontown content desert since toontown corporate clash is fucking dead and afk and i refuse to play toontown rewritten. no beef but i would like a more modern take on the now 23 something year old video game. its almost as old as me thats fucking crazy bro. anyways grindworks is a rougelike or a rougelite if you want to be really annyoning about it. i always have a phase where i sink like 40 hours in a week into a rougelike every year and this one was toontown so i was all for it. the actual game itself is alright and the characters/items are neat enough (shoutouts goggles), but the real beauty was in how the game itself was open source. no code behind locked doors or mysterious dev teams; it was just there for you to mod. it was like 2 days of playing the game and then like 5 days of trying to figure out all of the source code and shit before making a custom character, which came out freakin awesome[^3] mind you. i wont get into the whole coding process and stuff because there wasnt really a process lol. i had like 20 things to change and just dicked around in the code until i got it to do what i wanted. sidenote i never realized how similar high level coding languages were. gdscript looked like balls for like an hour and then it was just python the whole time and then python just looked like javascript with indents and not length syntax. anyways im gonna keep talking about code but in the aspect of purely reading and understanding code. for the past 6 months or so in trying to build my resume ive been mostly writing code from the ground up. at the most i read documentation for libraries but mostly everything ive made has been from scratch (shoutouts hakurei gooner for being the only time where i had to read other (acrid) people's (quan) code). this is like the first time ive sat down and read the various systems of a game and how they work together. legit feels like the wild west since it hasnt even been a week since the game came out; the open source repo has like 2 updates, theres not even a modloader yet, and people are building mods from the fucking game engine lmao. like i had to tell bree to download the godot engine, and launch my modded zip through there. i can see why modloaders and things of that nature are so important now from a developer perspective, and i do have a boatload more respect for people who make tooling like that. however i DONT have respect for how the devs of this game preloaded a fuck ton of things meaning that mods that can be loaded from a modloader are harder to develop because of how restrictive it is. getting or doing anything becomes 10000x more annoying and at that point i would rather ruin the source code just so i can print poop balls on the top right of a users screen. hopefully the modding api and the source code structure improves as time goes on, which im sure it will. it has crazy people like me going 8 hours a day on this shit!! i released my mod like 9 hours ago and i got one epic comment and then it made the whole thing worth it. i would never touch game dev with a 10 foot pole but i think modding new games and shit would be fun if i did it more. it also helps that grindworks is so open source that i can pop into the discord and ask the devs themselves whats up.

i like dropped everything for toontown and then i realized i need to not do that so i decided to start cooking a 23 minute osu map on the side with a song from GYARI[^4]. its some jazz fusion piece that is 23 minutes for no reason and has very little words in it. the english version is literally "Vocaloids just screaming" fucking banger man. ive felt full of energy the whole week since i just pour time on these projects but sometimes i get scared that im hyperfixating too hard. like surely i should be tired at some point and not be pulling a 24 hour day for free. idk if thats a bad thing to be afraid of having energy still after a strenous creative session. maybe i think that i havent put enough effort or energy but thats a big fucking lie cuz i certainly have (or certainly felt like it; i am proud of the work ive done in the past week). its quite interesting and i wonder what other people think or if theyve had bursts of energy like that. why did i write all of this down? well im certainly not procrastinating mapping the song i just described to you and im certainly not gearing up for 4 hours of mapping before i play cs2 with my Great Friends... i just felt like writing and doing this stream of conchiousness vibe for once instead of writing BECAUSE i had nothing else better to do. i also have this madoka post on hold because my bastard watch party is so bastard busy with bastard real life fucking hell. bro. we all forgot on different days last week but its everyones fault and not mine. cant wait to have a REAL media post instead of this ladybug and this freaking MINIONS MOVIE on my blog. speaking of ladybug (MARCH 23 NEW EPISODEEEE) i found this miraculous social media AU[^5] and its the funniest shit ive ever read. in confirming that i enjoy this AU i could only imagine my life if i fell into the tumblr hole like 10 years ago instead of ignoring it. did you know i was a brony like 10 years ago? i even used it as a guest to read the jappleack saga (big ups if you even remember that). it wouldve been the perfect storm of bullshit for a little guy like me entering high school. 

off the dome writing is fun as hell i should do this more. and i will NOT be proofreading this very carefully i want all of my intent to be captured on the screen, as if it was a painting. (ill catch mistakes if i do make them like as i type em though dw) this painting's vibe is one of swirling ideas gathered into a tornado. a real fast swirl of ideas that HOPEFULLY get met. i still have to update this website with date filters and night mode fuck my chungus one person life FUCK

now i have to do the footnotes bro this shit so ass i should just have footnotes automatically made straight from the cranium ffs (Final time: 47 minutes)
