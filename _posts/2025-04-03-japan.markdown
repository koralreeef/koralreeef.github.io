# pre-trip
family vacation isnt that so fun!!

i am typing this in advance because i will probably be twiddling my thumbs at the airport finally writing out my rebellion post that i know all of you have been dying to read. it will be very boring in there!!! i think the flight is like 10-12h and all i have is my sketchbook and some movies to pass the time. i might even download some ladybug fanfics or something. ohh i could read the entirety of "the inner game of tennis" nvm ill just do that good shit. update i downloaded all of blue box and frieren i cant wait to read for 14 hours straight 

## april 3-5 
2h drive, 5h waiting in sfo, 12h flight, 3h waiting in haneda airport (cool airport except for these "ai master" banners everywhere), 1h bus drive, 1h in security check, 1h waiting for room to be ready, WOohoo we're finally at our stateroom ok im reading the rest of blue box for the next 12 hours 

## april 6
this trip is a cruise from the bottom to the top of japan with a sidetrip to south korea for 14 days. day 1-3 is travel and then day 4 is nagasaki. gonna be honest i have no idea what to expect because my parents planned this so hopefully its fun. past vacations had me going to like 20 different churches in random countries and being very bored (i was also like 12 at the time all i wantrd to do was play video games and osu i didnt gaf about travel when i was that young lol). the airport adventure was neat, theres a lottttt of pokemon everywhere even on the safety videos. i also spent my first yen on habanero chips and a minecraft gachapon. i got the allay aka low roll kill yourself roll but its ok. kinda dope they even got a minecraft machine there when everything else is like one piece and shin-chan. there was actually a tim-tam? gachapon for some reason i shouldve played that lowkey. the tim-tam keychain wouldve been elite

i cant believe theres public bidets in the airport. they got a pressure level 1-5 (3 was powerful for me) and a BUTT DRYER like WHAT?? actual life changing moment when my ass got assulted on two fronts

i shouldve downloaded more manga while i had the chance; reading blue box and then reflecting on it while being at the top of the deck of the ship at night is some crazy #vibe
i also dont have internet for a while because idek if theres gonna be more free wifi spots outside of the airport. first time in a while where i havent been able to check discord maybe itll be good for me. then again im still on The Phone 24/7 but strictly for reading purposes. FFS THERES A BASKETBALL COURT I GUESS IM PRACTICING BALL FOR 2 WEEKS

my camera roll is fucked its like a 1:10 ratio of actual pictures to blue box panels (hina)

## april 7
i slept from 1-6 cuz i was cranking manga and blue box after dinner. visiting nagasaki today its gonna be an emotional one (peace museum, ground zero) gonna try to download beck while at land aswell i havent thought about that series in years it might be peak. i also need something more lighthearted after madoka different story destroyed me

nagasaki was fun. i found wifi and the tour was mosty history focused so we visited a dejima (manmade island), the peace park, the atomic bomb museum, and the glover garden. i cba to post pictures when i cant see the preview so youll have to wait on that. highlights include being in a 4 tatami wide room, eating a full course japanese meal, and eating a castella ice cream sandwich (it sucked) i also got #rocked by another public bidet and it wasnt even my fault because i set the water pressure to level 1 this time. i bought a little castella keychain guy from the dejima shop and a world peace shirt from the museum. powerful stuff reading the testimony from the atomic bomb survivors, very heavy. 
drink of the day: aquarius; very light, taste and look reminds me of white gatorade. very refreshing on a hot day

## april 8
drink of the day: pocari sweat; looks like aquarius, not as sweet as aquarius but still very good. mine was kinda lukewarm so maybe ill chug my water and then put in pocari sweat into my flask

busan highlights: jalgachi fish market, camellia park, and getting lost in a back alley market. definitely the most tiring day so far just because theres so many damn people doing the same tour as us that the venues just get swamped with buses and people after like 10 minutes. seafood market is sensory overload on its own though; shit is so crazy seeing live fish everywhere, some old lady chopping up fish parts like she dgaf, the water splashing everywhere, the SMELL, and the general noise is a one of a kind experience you wont really get anywhere else. maybe if ur in another third world asian country you can capture the magic (my parents said the filipino seafood markets was much dirtier than this one). 

bought this epic shinchan reusable bag, a shin ramyun pin, a snoopy pin and another little epic hearts guy pin for 8 bucks in total. i was able to kinda recreate the famous cookiezi eating a cookie picture except my coordinates were totally wrong and the angle was a bit off, but not bad for trying to take a pic in rush hour in a crosswalk in inner busan. i found these squid game cookies to do the picture with which was just hilarious. the fucking box cover has low res jpeg cookies on the front and they were 3 bucks for 12. i wish they were any good but its ok. feels just like the philippines in the alley markets because theres random cars and motorbikes that just go through and the pedestrians have to lock in to not get freaking run over. 

## april 9
drink of the day: "sports drink" with a d-price logo on it i have no clue what the japanese says on the bottle. the aftertaste is worse than the other two drinks, def not the best drink ive had so far. still tastes like white gatorade

sakaiminato! ive never heard of this city before but this is def my favorite so far. we got a castle, we got a river boat ride thing, and we got the adachi museum, an art and japanese garden combo thing. i think it helps that everything was way less crowded. got a lot of great photos on the river and atop the castle. seeing a legit japanese garden is pretty insane. its not just the design of the garden, but also the scale. this thing is like 3-4 miles long with some mountain waterfalls taken into account, and built around them. eyecandy wherever you look. on the art museum side, i really fw yokoyama taikan and his works. its all flowers, trees, and cliffside/beach environments, and you know im a sucker for all of that. theres also a great side exhibition called "pictures for children" with some realllyyyy good works. the list of artists are: Hayashi Yoshio, Suzuki Toshio, Takei Takeo, Kawakami Shiro, Kurosaki Yoshisuke, and Iguchi Bunshu. i bought two prints from yoshio's collection; apples and night owl. gonna be good collections to the wall
