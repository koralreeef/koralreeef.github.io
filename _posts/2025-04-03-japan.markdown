family vacation isnt that so fun!!

i am typing this in advance because i will probably be twiddling my thumbs at the airport finally writing out my rebellion post that i know all of you have been dying to read. it will be very boring in there!!! i think the flight is like 10-12h and all i have is my sketchbook and some movies to pass the time. i might even download some ladybug fanfics or something. ohh i could read the entirety of "the inner game of tennis" nvm ill just do that good shit
