idk why jekyll dating is farked up but this post will live here as long as its not fixed (my first post was made on the 17th, not the 18th)

this post is "made" on the 16th!

i guess i need to take into account when i actually made the post, maybe some weirdness with deploying marks it as not the 17th?

update (2/18/25) ok hopefully me actually giving a timezone in the config file fixes this. i guess denoting the timezone in the front headers wasnt enough?

test commit on phone to see if i need my laptop or not
