even with its insanely inconsistent writing, less than stellar animation, and the fact that im not the target audience...

its true i do love this show like a lot

im not a huge media watcher type of guy so my opinion of shows is a bit skewed towards western cartoons and anime that only my friends mega vouch and recommend. as a hopeless romantic, im just such a sucker for shipping type shows and the "will they wont they" dynamic is something ill never get tired of. the two anime i enjoyed (and the only ones i probably watched) the most last year were [kaguya sama love is war](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen), and [monogatari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series__Second_Season) (up to owari). love is war is way more similar to the dynamic that ladybug has, while monogatari is a show that has me on the edge of my seat while two (or more) characters just talk about some nonsensical shit for the whole runtime. two completely different shows with both unbelivable premises and character abilities, and yet i just adore how real the characters themselves feel. of course there are MANY exceptions (ESPECIALLY FOR MONOGATARI...) but i think my favorite moments are always when its just two characters talking about anything for an extended period of time. a shame that the second half of kaguya hasnt been adapted but many such cases post-ova in the manga really warm my heart when i reread those chapters. in monogatari's case, i will bring up the [timeless classic](https://youtu.be/rS4jWFfzFPg?t=238) of araragi lowkey sexually harassing senjougahara while they talk about fucking nothing at a playground set.

the episodes i enjoy the most with ladybug are either crazy lore drops, or if marinette and adrien talk in coherent and complete sentences for more than 30 seconds. 

its not just about how ladybug has this "will they wont they" dynamic, but also about some of the surprisingly modern lessons that it tries to teach its audience. for example
