"now listen to me, wantanabe. i want you to forget all about that sad little funeral you saw. just remember this marvellous one of ours."

thanks quan for recommending this it really made my last day at sea not boring af at all. god damn this book is tragic but also kinda ridiculous to the point where you cant help but chuckle. i think this is my first time reading a book front to back in..... in uh...... oh my god whens the last time i fucking read a book?? HIGH SCHOOL? god i hope not. ok my memory is jogged and the last book i read in full was a memoir for an english class in my 3rd semester of college, so around 4 years ago. it was quite the read so ill find the title whenever i get the chance. i remember now that that book had me in a daze much like this but for completely different reasons. i knew that the memoir was a real experience living in mexico with a tattered relationship. HOWEVER i genuinely felt as if the characters and the story were real. idk how i thought this book was a autobiography but i was so convinced that this shit happened and wanted like another 700 pages on this dudes life and how he lived with the sorrow of almost everyone he knew killing themselves or dying. at some point it felt like a sick joke with how a majority of the people tied to watanabe kill themselves at some point during the narration. cant believe i forgot how powerful writing can truly be. as i kept reading i noted down the page numbers and deciding to take a nap after hitting a certain number. this went on from page 60 to page 162. after hitting that page i was reading into a blur and my internal imagery was getting so scrambled i just had to put the book down. half from how murakami structures his own imagery for the reader and half from the story itself. if i remember right the page i stopped on had already gone through the first sanitarium visit and this relationship with midori had me in shambles. i dont even know how to describe this book or recommend it; its one of those pieces of media that is so sad but incredibly gripping; it would be an insult to try and box this thing into a singular label. at least, i dont have the writing chops right now to even formulate what i think about it. remind me in a year and i might discover just a bit more to do this justice

livetweetz

everyone in this book is fucked up and i cant fix any of them if i tried holy fuk

reiko's story legit had me jaw dropped i wanted to cover my eyes with how this scene was being described to me; felt straight out of a fucked up doujin or somethin

deaths throughout the book have been written so abruptly its insane; i guess it makes its point quite well that death is any other ordinary thing that happens as much as breathing or the sun shining. never failed to surprise me though

disassociating at dinner thinking about reiko and naoko
