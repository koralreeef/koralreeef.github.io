new things for you to explore, how exciting!

we now have some latest art above the blog, and a whole [art feed](/galleryfeed.html) for me to funnel new drawings into.  my touhou 1cc history is now avaliable through the games history link on the left side. its still quite a ways away from looking good but the base skeleton is there. all i have to do is just fill it with a lot of writing yayyy

i still have to figure out some structure regarding the speedrunning/game history table cuz idk what i want it to look like still lol
