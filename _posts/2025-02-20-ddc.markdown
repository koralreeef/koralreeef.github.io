double dealing chungus - touhosu 

this is probably going on the backburner until i can put proper time for this game, its so fucking hard to learn

the normal 1cc on this character is like a hard 1cc somewhere else, she is so fucking bad in this game its crazy

its not even her fault its just that the game does NOT support honest forward shooting characters
