"on this planet you call females who have yet to become adults, girls. it makes sense then that since you'll eventually become witches, you should be called magical girls."

there will be spoilers in this post!!! this writeup is also before i watch rebellion (movie 3)

after my watch party crew (me, my good mate john, and quan) caught up with ladybug we were freakin DESPERATE AND STARVING for a new anything to watch. i brought up that i wanted to at least pay respects to some of the anime classics and then we found out that the english dub has marinette's (ladybug) va as homura's va. this singlehandedly got me to instantly put on madoka even though we were looking through a bunch of other classics and karl anime (getting recommended sunny boy) and the other backlogged western cartoon list that is slowly growing (my bad john). god bless cristina vee[^1] btw for being such a good va bro, shes a completely different voice when shes locked in as homura. she legit sounds like marinette when homura with braids is on screen its really funny. i couldnt stop cheesing during the first couple episodes because i kept thinking to myself "haha ladybug wouldnt be so cold to my main girl madoka thats so silly". also regarding homura, i knew one very important thing coming into this show. sadly, the youtube algorithm spoiled me on the big mystery of homura akemi when it decided to show me a video titled "Time Travel isn't Good"[^2] and a thumbnail with FREAKING HOMURA AND OKABE ON IT. i think im spoiled on stein's gate too now but whatever bro its ok. it didnt really spoil my enjoyment of seeing the twist unravel but i do wish i was able to capture on the hype of the twist. sidenote im such a sucker for big reveal/surprises/twists/whatever the fuck happens that flips the show on its head in the current moment. i know thats like why people even give a fuck about shows sometimes to see the growth in a character as you watch them throughout a series but thats usually what i look forward to. i think i touched upon that in my ladybug post but i think i kinda emphasized the """human""" aspect[^3] rather than like just the growth of a character. its really fun to watch except maybe when the character goes through 20 lifetimes of hell just to come out the other side not dead (shoutouts luz noceda/anne boonchuy). oh hey thats what homura did lmfao.

knowing all of this, i still didnt really have a clue on what the show was about at first. i knew that kyubey from frame 1 was a little rat and that being a magical girl wasnt really the best option in this universe; it was quite cool to see just how much a person traded away to become a magical girl. i guess a wish is quite powerful after all. sayaka in particular was an insane character to see unfold as you were introduced to more of the magical girl rules through her. her situation was an absolute fucking tragedy and all she had was good intentions. also my jaw dropped as madoka fucking THREW HER SOUL GEM OFF A HIGHWAY BRIDGE LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS MADOKA... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK... you combine that scene with the next episode's ending of sayaka fucking tanking the shit out of a witch and then losing her sanity in real time dude im getting chills just thinking about it no lie #nocap. and then nah like why did her friend drop the mic and said im confessing to the bro like COME ON BRO WE ACTUALLY JUST TANKED 1000 DAMAGE AND NOW THIS BRO; im surprised the soul gem didnt fucking explode instantly after she saw those two on the bench like holy fuck. the sayaka kyoko church scene also had me in the blender, just so insane and unlucky and fucked up that wishes always have their price to pay. rip mami bro i really didnt expect for her to die frame 1 but i had a tiny feeling that something bad would happen when she was trying to gas up madoka to be a magical girl. she convinced sayaka unfortunately... i had my gripes before the homura future reveal that mami was kinda underused but holy shit one of the timelines just had an unbelievable crashout when they find out that witches are born from magical girls. just fucking DROPS KYOKO IN THE SKULL (the soul gem) AND THEN MADOKA HAS TO DROP HER HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT MAN. i just watched this scene because i forgot who killed who and holy shit rewatching this whole thing is unbelivable. the #mamicrashout is fucking legit as hell her character broke down instantly. homura is actually a fucking freak for suggesting they just turn the whole world into dust man holy shit. ok i paused the episode and we're on... homura! shes such a mysterious character thats kinda afk but is canon op and then you see her progression into becoming what she is and then shes absolutely elite. the way she latched onto madoka so fucking hard kinda reminds me of the araragi hanekawa dynamic except its a one way thing instead of both of them think they should kill themselves for the other one if needed. and it was kinda leaning towards the latter in some of these timelines anyway lol. cant believe homura gets the ultimate middle finger by the universe with her wish. trying to protect madoka and fulfill her mission of not letting madoka become a magical girl just so that madoka becomes a fucking DEITY instead, being """protected""" forever. actually that whole twist of madoka becoming the greatest magical girl (WITCH) because of how homura raised madoka's karmic destiny was insane and twisted. fucking awesome how she just started a chain reaction like that. i hope she never loses that hairbow in rebellion oh my goodness man. i do wonder whats gonna happen to madoka as a deity. is her wish ever gonna backfire like can she die to taking in all of these curses and shit?? im reading this over and i really didnt talk about madoka herself much. good kid tries to do her best but most of the show is her witnessing her friends die in real time its kinda fucked. her pep talk didnt even work on sayaka man thats so sad actually. and then she threw the fucking soul gem off the fucking bridge oh my god ok sorry i wont bring it up again. maybe i should rewatch the first couple of episodes again since she didnt leave much of an impression on me until near the end when she cried because homura finally called her madoka that was fucking epic.[^4] maybe that was the point cuz like homura is right there and she also caused all of this lmao. actually thats a lie the world wouldve ended without madoka becoming god so good job homura.

with my amazing monogatari watching experience in the bag i was pretty hyped to find out from like the first 5 minutes that this was a shaft show. more specifically the director was the same guy who did monogatari, Akiyuki Shinbo. every head tilt[^5] recieved 20 applauses and every random ass surreal background shot got 50 applauses. i gotta gush over the mixed media aspect when it came to the labyrinth setting or when a witch/familiar was on screen. ABSOLUTELY PEAK with how they were combining the characters along with paper cutout style imagery. i dont think ive actually watched any anime thats used mixed media as much as madoka. im surprised ive never heard of good things from madoka in the visual sense since it just kicks so much ass on that front alone. a special shoutouts to sayaka's sanity loss scene because the use of negative space was just so fucking unbelivable; it was insane to see just how much pain she was taking in that moment and not giving a fuck. at least 200 stabs through the body and she just starts laughing like a fucking maniac bro oh my days. anyways yes visually this show was awesome, the designs even more so. if you know me you know i love a good anime girl with a gun so having like 3 ranged characters out of 5 was an insanely big up from me. im actually kinda sad they killed off mami so quickly because her style of combat was so fucking cool and sick and epic and woohoo. actually im now thinking about it and mami dies early, madoka doesnt get to be a magical girl until the very end, and we dont even get to see what the fuck homura does until she drops kyubey in the skull; never mind, the melee characters win this one. god damn it. homura doesnt even use that many guns either she tries to use like an equivalent to a nuke and walpurgisnacht (had to look this up as i was writing) doesnt even care so nice try i guess. when they reveal that homura switched her weapon to madoka's bow because she had a new wish was fucking lit and awesome. i just figured out as i was writing that last sentence that homura had been able to wish for something else since madoka doesnt exist in that timeline fucking awesome. i hope that comes up in rebellion it would be cool. 

what a great freaking show! i now understand why people hail it as a classic, and as to why people really freaking love miss homura akemi even though madoka is the household name
