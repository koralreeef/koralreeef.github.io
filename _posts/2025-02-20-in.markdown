watching mokou's boss fight 16-17 years ago put my life on a different trajectory i think

its still the game i hold the most nostalgia for

# border team <a name="border-team"></a> 
the classico

wasnt too hard to get this run since the eosd piss grind was a month ago before this

# solo sakuya <a name="solo-sakuya"></a> 
i cant believe i did this run actually

this is one of the worst shot types ive ever played and its not even close bro, you just pepper the bosses SHINS for almost the whole spell card runtime
