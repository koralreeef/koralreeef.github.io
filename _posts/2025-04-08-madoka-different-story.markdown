 "i'm sorry miki-san. i really can't be called a hero anymore."


## volume 1
so this is a spinoff manga from the same guys who did the original manga based off the anime. its told from the perspective of mami and sorta follows the anime timeline except mami lives when she saves sayaka and madoka instead of dies it should be epic

(midway through ch2) oh crap kyoukos dad hasnt crashed out yet im actually so nervous now what the hell? it was so normal before right now (ch3) its over bro

wow that was a fantastic set up for kyouko's current character in the anime it just hurts so much more that mami's philosophy towards witches is fully show because of her insane crashout in ep10. thats actually fucked that she drops kyouko first during that lmfao holy shit. the action panels are pretty insane and sometimes unreadable but it captures the anime vibe very well. insanely small nitpick but i wouldve loved to see some cutout screenshotting action but the witches already being pretty esoteric designs is fine. we also get mami lore and what her wish actually was, which makes a ton of sense considering her strength and what she believes in. meanwhile kyouko just loses her clone magic and goes beast mode on people anyways solely from how cynical she is god damn. actually so fucking sad how her dad actually takes her wish in the worst way possible even if the wish itself was kinda fucking dogshit. WELCOME BACK MADOKA AND HOMURA AND SAYAKA WOOHOO FUCK YOU KYUUBEY

## volume 2
(literal first page) forgot to mention this in volume 1 but having the weapon or the impact strike extend past panels is so eyecandy and cum i love that effect so much dude (ch5) kyouko has played these games before and im sorry sayaka and madoka but shes right and you guys are about to have the world dropped on your dumb heads ffs ALSO HI HOMURA WOOHOO 
(ch7) MADOKA FUCKJNG DID WHAT?? NO WAY WE'RE ACTUALLY TELLING THE BRO THAT HER WISH WAS TO FIX HIS HANDS WHATTTTT just realized this was the parallel to madoka throwing sayakas soul gem off the fucking bridge but less stupid but actually this is hella stupid i tjink. hitomi proves to be a backstabbing BITCH ASS fuck you hitomi

this spinoff is ridiculous bro the negative space mightve been done even better in the manga but idk. it is supremely powerful in how mami breaks down her own character in front of a dying sayaka, drawn in the same negative space effect in the anime when sayaka gets stabbed 90000 times and fully becomes unsavable. AMAZING amazing amazing. SHE NEVER EVEN TOLD KYOUSUKE HER FULL SECRET MAN WTF KYOUKO WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG AAAHHHHJHHHH im jumping! off the ship i tjink fuck my life ok im gonna read the rest

## volume 3
broke my heart man ill write this when i wake up but holy shit bro im so heartbroken the dialogue when she kills sayaka's witch and then talks to her dad oh
my fucking god Ohhhh my god bro its geniunely so sad. i also fell for the illusion but that shit aint even matter mami is so mentally unstable she tried to kill kyouko 20 billion times jesus
ending so brutal im sitting in the library blank staring into space thinking about how fucking tragic this timeline went. madoka saves? sayaka and then they all die to walpurgisnacht anyway and homura has to restart gg. the final ending sequence of mami's dream of having a nice get together was also just unbelivably sad, she tried to hard to work for something she could never have. kyuubey went 30-0 this timeline he really emotionally destroyed everyone mami almost fucking died on the spot from that one
the theme of loneliness and family was very unexpected but i really loved how it tied in with the two characters that lost their families because of their wishes when becoming magical girls. shit runs so deep when they reveal mami and kyouko's history and kyouko's crashout regarding her family. makes me wonder if kyouko couldve saved sayaka if she didnt flame her wish frame 1 and instead talked about her family (which is impossible because sayaka literally did the same wish for someone else's sake as kyouko. thinking about it madoka also did the same thing but in this timeline she never figured out that witches are born from magical girls so nt on that one guys) ok i will go take a nap and develop this further hold on
ok i took the nap and i think i need to reread all of the mami kyouko dialogue because its so packed with shit and i probably forgot some important turning points that resulted in this mess; particularly the parts after kyouko leaves mitakihara for the first time. actually i kinda forgot how sayaka and kyouko's relationship played out because i know she slandered the fuck out of mami and flamed sayaka's wish but i have no clue what happened after that. just got emotional over the fact that mami saw sayaka turn into a witch this timeline and not kyouko and also oh my god mami knowing that magical girls turn into witches is just horrible. my number one crashout queen absolutely cannot take that and yet she won her duel against kyouko as a way to kill herself and fall into despair like what the FUCK is that bro?

if you need mami/kyouko content then tap in on this immediately otherwise you can skip but its still a great read
