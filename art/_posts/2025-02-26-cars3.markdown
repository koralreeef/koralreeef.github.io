got the wonderful idea to combine shaft shots and miraculous ladybug

hair references are so hard to find esp for marinette having her hair down because that shit does not move in the show lol. very happy with both of these though, i would love to do more unserious sketches with heavily detailed cars since thats the important part whenever i do car stuff. you should watch the miraculous ladybug x volkswagen commerical[^1], a treasure trove of references and also they let 14 year olds drive cars wtf?
