i chose these frames a week ago and then played minecraft for a week, sorryyyyy

im getting better at redrawing in shaft style i think but i wanted to kinda emphasize and introduce more cross hatching. since im not coloring this, i think cross hatching and its intensity make shadows and shading rly pop out in a colorless sketch like these. i like it so it will not go away until i think its ugly for what i want. this perspective on the bottom for the first image fucked my shit though that one was so hard to draw. and to think they animated that shit!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?? WTF

rebellion review will come out when it comes out (spoiler: i liked it a lot)
