skimmed through madoka and looked for fun and wonderful homura frames to redraw

some of these came out crazy fast and others took a long time; i need to rly lock in on a good workflow for sketches. i also did this framing thing idk if i like it but it was neat. i should just draw whenever i get an idea its so stupid not drawing whenever i feel like drawing bro
